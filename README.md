## Getting Started

### TL;DR

[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyxmidnight/ao3tagsfonts/master/css/ao3butbetter.user.css)

### Prerequisites

This is a **user stylesheet** that gets applied to a **website** thanks to a **userstyle manager extension** installed in your browser. You will need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets. I personally use **Stylus** (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), for [Chrome & Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), for [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)).

### Installing

1.  Using a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets (see **Prerequisites**), open the raw file within the browser by clicking on the next link.
    :package: [Install the userCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyxmidnight/ao3tagsfonts/master/css/ao3butbetter.user.css)
2.  The userstyle manager will open the stylesheet. The sidebar on the left will have an **Install Style** button to install the user style. Below is a checkbox to receive updates. Leave it checked to automatically receive the updated stylesheet whenever I update it.
3.  Click the **Install Style** button to install the user style in your browser.
4.  :tada: Enjoy improved readability on AO3!

#### To Set Custom Fonts

1.  Navigate to [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org).
2.  Click on the Stylus icon in your toolbar. A list of stylesheets applied at this URL will appear. **Better AO3 Tags and Fonts** will appear with three icons to the right: a gear, a pencil, and three vertical dots.
3.  Click on the gear :gear:. A modal dialog appears with 4 menus: Site interface font, Work summary font, Story body font, News and docs font.
4.  Pick a font from each of the dropdown menus (it can be all the same font or a different font for each, all that matters is your reading comfort).
5.  If auto save is not enabled, click on the save button.
6.  Optionally, enable auto save.
7.  Enjoy better readability on AO3!

#### On Custom Fonts

This user stylesheet includes an optional configuration modal with dropdown menus to select the font(s) you wish to use on AO3. The font selected in this menu will **only** work if you have the corresponding font installed on the computer you are currently using. Here is a list of the fonts available in the menu. Some are web-safe option that come pre-installed on different Mac and Windows computers, while some are free fonts. I have provided links to download the free fonts.

-   system-ui: This option uses the default system font pre-installed on a Mac computer or an iOS phone.
-   Segoe UI: A font that comes pre-installed with Windows and Windows program for Windows 7 to 10 inclusively.
-   Arial: A web-safe option that comes pre-installed on most Mac and Windows computers.
-   Helvetica Neue: A common pre-installed Mac font.
-   [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/): An open source font by Warsaw-based designer ≈Åukasz Dziedzic that can be downloaded and installed for free.
-   [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/): An open source font made by Google. This family of fonts was created for consistency across many different languages, even those that do not use the Latin alphabet. A personal favourite of mine. Can be downloaded and installed for free.
-   [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/): As the website says, "[A] typeface designed against some common symptoms of dyslexia." Hopefully, if you are dyslexic, using it will make AO3 easier to read. Can be downloaded and installed for free (donations appreciated).
-   [Open Sans](https://www.opensans.com/): An open source font commissioned by Google and designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. Can be downloaded and installed for free.
-   Roboto: A font pre-installed on Android devices.
-   Trebuchet MS: A font pre-installed on Windows XP, macOS, iOS and Chrome OS.
-   [Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/): An open source font designed for Ubuntu (Linux).
-   Verdana: Another common web-safe font pre-installed on most Windows and Mac computers. This font is easy to read at low resolutions.
-   sans-serif: If all else fails, this option uses the default sans-serif font on your machine.

### Roadmap

-   [ ] Do a page review throughout the archive, both logged in and logged out, to detect any place where the stylesheet does not behave as expected.
-   [ ] Correct the bugs/issues found in the above-mentioned review.
-   [ ] Create a wiki for this repository for more in-depth explanations for less tech-savvy users, complete documentation, and declutter this README.
-   [ ] Take better screenshots to better document the differences between plain AO3 and AO3 with the stylesheet applied, and blur out names.
-   [ ] Investigate the possibility of converting this stylesheet into an AO3 Site Skin.
-   [x] Convert to UserCSS format for easy installation with the Stylus browser extension.
-   [x] Add user customizable variables.
-   [x] Fix spacing issues with icon labels.
-   [x] Fix overlapping text issues in Series headings.

### Versioning

I use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for versioning. To summarize: each version is numbered according to a (major).(minor).(patch) numbering scheme. If the (patch) number goes up, that's a backward compatible bug fix. If the (minor) patch number goes up, that's a backward compatible new function added. If the (major) number goes up, that's a whole new version that is not backward compatible.

### Contributing
