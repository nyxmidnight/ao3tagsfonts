# Security Policy

This project is a user stylesheet, so security should not be a concern. Nevertheless, you should never say "never" in IT.

## Supported Versions

The latest version of the user stylesheet is the version being supported with potential security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x.x   | *Upcoming version* |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability or security issue:

1. Click on the [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/nyxmidnight/ao3tagsfonts/security/advisories/new) button in the top right corner of the page to write a draft "Security Advisory".
   1. **Draft Security Advisory are only visible to the project maintainers** aka me, [Nyx Midnight](https://github.com/nyxmidnight).
1. I will try my best to get back to you within 48 hours. Please keep in mind that this is a hobby project and that I have a non-IT day job to keep up with.
1. If the security advisory does apply to this project, I will do my absolute best to get it either fixed (or mitigated if not fixable) within a week.
1. If the security advisory applies to this project, I will publish it publicly on the repository.

GitHub has a documentation section on [Best practices for writing repository security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/best-practices-for-writing-repository-security-advisories)

Thank you.
